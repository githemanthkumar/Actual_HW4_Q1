# Actual_HW4_Q1
This Python function performs basic NLP preprocessing on a given sentence in three steps. First, it tokenizes the input sentence, meaning it splits the text into individual words and punctuation marks, making it easier to work with each part separately. Next, it removes common English stopwords—these are words like "the," "in," or "are," which usually don’t add significant meaning and can clutter the analysis. After stopword removal, the function keeps only the meaningful words. Finally, it applies stemming using the Porter Stemmer, which reduces each remaining word to its base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"). This step simplifies different forms of a word into a common base, making further analysis more efficient. Throughout the process, the function prints the outputs at each stage: original tokens, tokens after stopword removal, and the stemmed tokens. This helps clearly show the transformation at every preprocessing step.
